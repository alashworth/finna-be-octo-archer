\section{Board Overview}
The principal aim of the design was to develop an energy and reasonably cost-efficient wireless sensing platform, with easy expandability so as to support arbitrary sensor attachments. This section discusses the design and implementation of the board, along with the rationale behind certain hardware choices.

The designed sensor platform is a small, credit-card sized board. Temperature, humidity, and ambient light-levels are measured on-board, while the remaining micro-controller general purpose input-output (GPIO) is broken out to a standard 0.1" pitch header. The board is based on the Texas Instruments CC3200 system-on-a-chip (SOC), containing an ARM-M4 MCU and an 802.11 WiFi radio.

The Texas Instruments CC3200 was chosen after evaluating several different chips from Freecale, Atmel, and other manufacturers. A sample comparison is presented in table \ref{uc-comparison}. Important characteristics for a microcontroller were: 1) power consumption, 2) memory size, 3) easy of programmability, and 4) transceiver integration. The CC3200 is neither very low power nor is it very inexpensive due to requiring an external flash memory module. However, it has several advantages as a chipset for a residential sensing platform. First, it supports 802.11b/g/n, which is ubiquitous in residential buildings. Given the typical 4-5 node scale of an ecoMOD deployment, not having to purchase an inter-networking gateway more than makes up for the slightly higher cost of the chip, which is around \$11 in quantity from DigiKey. Second, it is based on the Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller, which means it can be programmed with open-source (i.e., free) toolchains, and has a floating-point coprocessor for digital signal processing. Finally, the CC3200 is a hybrid package, with an integrated balun and matching network. Any single-ended 50 Ohm antenna can be connected and it will theoretically just work, which is the exception, and not the rule.

\section{Sensors}

An environmental monitoring platform is useless without some way of measuring the environment. Although the design includes a 0.1" header for expandability, light, temperature, and humidity sensing was included on board. Where possible, I2C compatible sensors were chosen for ease of integration and lowered parts count. The sensor characteristics are summarized in table \ref{sensor-specs}. The bottom two entries in the table consist of external sensors that were connected to the microcontroller's ADC.

\end{table}

\subsection{Light}

The light sensor is the TSL2561. The response curve approximates the sensitivity of the human eye. Light levels are important in measuring solar insolation, which affects building heating and cooling schedules. This particular sensor contains two photodiodes on board - one more responsive to infra-red, and the other with an even full-spectrum frequency response curve. It is pre-calibrated from the manufacturer, and utilizes an SMBus/I2C interface.

\section{Humidity and Temperature}

The board mounts an integrated relative humidity and temperature sensor from Taos: the TSL2561. Accurate measurement of relative humidity is highly dependent on the atmospheric temperature. As a result, most instrumentation-grade humidity sensors come with a temperature sensor for free. The sensor is based on sensing changes in capacitance, and comes pre-calibrated from the factory. Humidity and temperature must be known in order to determine heating and cooling energy expenditures.

\section{Soil Moisture}

A capacitive soil moisture sensor from Vegetronix was tested. Soil moisture was an important environmental measure needed for ecoMOD 4, which had a ground source heat pump. The greater the soil moisture, the more thermal capacity the heat pump has to draw on. The sensor has an output voltage range of 0 to 3V. As the CC3200 ADC inputs can only tolerate a maximum voltage of 1.5V; the sensor output voltage must be divided by two for full range operation.

\section{Radio}

IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) has traditionally been used to provide high-speed, moderate range data transfer. Typical systems utilizing it have been fast but not energy-efficient, which has led to the perception of it being unsuitable for use in long-lifetime battery-powered devices. However, this is not from any inherent inefficiency in the protocol. In fact, the raw energy per bit transmitted is competitive with other protocols such as 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Low-Energy\cite{DanielDobkin2009}. In wireless device applications, power usage is dominated by one of four things:

\begin{description}
\item[Duty cycle] the ratio of device operation time to device idle time
\item[Protocol efficiency] different protocols lead to various amounts of communication overhead, and each one is tuned for different operating environments
\item[TX power] how efficient power is used to transmit, along with the efficiency of the transmit amplifier
\item[Signal processing] how much energy is consumed by the microcontroller in processing and acquiring data 
\end{description}

The sensor node is designed to be small and non-invasive for easy deployment in residential and outdoor areas. The dimensions are sized to fit a standard Pelican 1010-series enclosure, so as to support an outdoor, battery-powered usage case. This case is rugged, waterproof, and made of transparent (optical and RF) polycarbonate.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The system is designed to run autonomously with little interaction by the user. Accordingly, there are no buttons or switches on the board, however, if user interaction is required, they can be added to the 0.1" header. In order to facilitate easy development, however, an FTDI dual serial to USB chip is included on the board's footprint. One port connects to the CC3200 UART, and another to the CC3200 JTAG pins. This simplifies the development process as a JTAG probe set is no longer needed for in-circuit debugging and firmware flashing. The trace powering the FTDI adapter can be cut via jumper if the board is intended for long term battery operation, or the chip omitted entirely if large-scale production is anticipated.

The CC3200 SoC is over-specified for the base use-case, and contains spare computational and memory capacity. The internal ARM-M4 micro-controller runs at 80 MHz from a pair of external 32.768 kHz and 40 MHz crystal oscillators. The model specified in this design contains 128 kB of RAM and is run from an 8 MB serial flash module accessed over the SPI bus. As the current firmware load consumes around 40 kilobytes of RAM during regular operation, expanded functionality can easily be programmed in the future.

IEEE 802.11 (WiFI) was chosen for the wireless protocol. It was picked because WiFi is a ubiquitous wireless standard. As opposed to other protocols, it is extremely unlikely that additional routers or gateways would need to be purchased in order to connect the sensor board to the Internet. It is also amenable to easy network administration through well-known tools, as opposed to a custom or more esoteric protocol. However, 802.11 is not known for being especially power efficient nor is it a simple protocol. It has only recently been true that cheap 802.11 transceivers have been made available to the low-volume market. The power consumption of the 802.11 protocol is addressed in software via compression and aggregation of sensed data, and adjusting the duty cycle of the radio so that it spends most of the time idle. This trade-off is acceptable for this design as the majority of nodes are not battery-powered, and of those which are, most do not need to transmit data in real-time, allowing for long sleep periods.

\section{Antenna Design}

The sensor board looks for three qualities in its antenna, in decreasing importance: cost, range, and compactness. Three antenna configurations were considered for the design. Planar inverted-F antennas (PIFA) are inexpensive and have a reasonable range, but are not as small as chip antennas. Ceramic chip antennas (CCA) are compact, but have poor range, and are expensive. Finally, externally mounted whip antennas have good range, but are also fairly expensive, and consume a large volume of space.

In this design, a PIFA was chosen. A PIFA has a simple structure, an omni-directional radiation pattern, and is very low-cost as it is fabricated as part of the PCB. It has an elliptical polarization, allowing it to receive both vertical and horizontally polarized waves\cite{huynh2000numerical}. This is important in an indoor environment as wireless waves often tend to become depolarized as they reflect off internal surfaces. In addition, one of the additional advantages of the PIFA is that it can be easily tuned by hand by fabricating the long arm of the F with excess length, and then scraping the excess surface copper until a good impedance match is obtained. For all these reasons, planar inverted-F antennas are extremely common in small electronic devices, and see common application in mobile handsets. Figure X shows the basic layout of a planar inverted-F antenna.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/pifa}
\caption[PIFA Layout]{A basic layout of a single band planar inverted-F antenna\cite{Rosu}.}
\label{fig:pifa}
\end{figure}


The PIFA has a few complexities in its design. Important factors are the size and aspect ratio of the F-structure, the height of the antenna over the ground plane, the position of the feed point, and the location of the shorting strap. These will all affect the electrical performance of the antenna.

A PIFA was designed and simulated in HFSS. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. \missingfigure{ HFSS PIFA PCB geometry}. The dielectric is standard 2-layer FR4 with a thickness of 1.6mm (63 mil) and 1 oz. copper traces and fills.
