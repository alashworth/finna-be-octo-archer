\chapter{Abstract}

The ecoMOD project at UVA is an effort from the architectural school in designing low-cost, energy-efficient housing. In order to validate architectural design choices, the buildings must be instrumented post-construction. Building environment monitoring can give key feedback on energy and resource consumption. This work explores the design of a small, energy efficient, wireless sensing platform, along with a variety of sensor attachments. These attachments can detect: soil moisture and temperature, ambient light, and air temperature. By building functional prototypes, I demonstrate sensor operation and show how they can be used to monitor a residential building.
